## Known Bugs/Issues
* Educational Enrichment can't be saved by itself
* Educational Enrichment should be a bucket for classes that aren't filling any requirements
* CGI script needs to be setup to fix permissions for DC server
* Site looks like it was made in the 90s
* COEN electives should turn yellow and display current count
* There should be an explicit way of informing users what requirements are filled by each class (parentheses maybe?)
